## Introduction
This document provides an overview and detailed instructions for the handover of the Django-based web application. The application uses Django for both backend and frontend development, along with Bootstrap for styling and ti icons for iconography.

## Project Overview
Purpose: This project is a [brief description of the app's functionality, e.g., task management tool, e-commerce site, etc.].
Primary Features:
User Authentication (Sign up, Login, Logout)
[List your key features]
Target Audience: [Who the application is intended for, e.g., small businesses, individual users, etc.]

## Technology Stack
Backend: Django (Python)
Frontend: Django templates, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Styling: Bootstrap 5
Icons: ti-icons (Themify Icons)
Database: SQLite (for development) / PostgreSQL (for production)
Other Libraries: [List any additional libraries used, e.g., jQuery, Django Rest Framework, Celery]

## Environment Setup
Development Environment:
Python 3.x
Django 3.x (or 4.x if you're using it)
Virtual Environment (venv or pipenv)
Node.js (if needed, for compiling assets like Bootstrap or for other frontend dependencies)
Steps to Set Up Development Environment:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/project.git
Create and activate a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run migrations:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Create a superuser for accessing the admin:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Run the development server:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
5. Deployment Instructions
The project is deployed using [your deployment platform, e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean]. Provide clear instructions on how the production environment is set up.
Steps to Deploy:
Set environment variables for production:
bash
Copy code
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=project.settings.production
Install production dependencies using:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Collect static files:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py collectstatic
Apply migrations:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Restart the server.
Note: Make sure to configure your production settings (project/settings/production.py) with the correct database, allowed hosts, and other relevant configurations.

6. Frontend Details
Bootstrap 5: The application uses Bootstrap for responsive design. The base template includes Bootstrap's CDN, and any custom styling is done through additional CSS files located in the static/css/ directory.
ti-icons (Themify Icons): Icons are implemented using ti-icons. Example usage:
html
Copy code
<i class="ti-home"></i>  <!-- Home Icon -->
7. Core Functionalities
7.1 User Authentication
Description: The app includes built-in user authentication using Django's auth system (sign up, login, logout).
Code Example (Login View):
python
Copy code
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

def login_view(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        username = request.POST['username']
        password = request.POST['password']
        user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)
        if user is not None:
            login(request, user)
            return redirect('dashboard')
    return render(request, 'login.html')
7.2 Feature 2 (e.g., Task Management)
Description: [Detailed explanation of the feature.]
Code Example (e.g., task creation):
python
Copy code
@login_required
def create_task(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        # Task creation logic
    return render(request, 'create_task.html')
8. Common Issues and Solutions
Issue 1: Static files not loading in production
Solution: Ensure STATIC_ROOT is correctly set in settings.py and run python manage.py collectstatic.
Issue 2: Database connection failure
Solution: Check that the correct database settings are configured in the production settings file.
9. User Guide
Logging In:
Navigate to the login page (/login/).
Enter your username and password.
On successful login, you'll be redirected to the dashboard.
Creating a Task:
Go to the task management page (/tasks/).
Click on "Create Task" and fill out the form.
10. Maintenance and Support
Scheduled Maintenance: Regular code reviews, updates to dependencies, and server monitoring.
Backup Strategy: Weekly backups of the database and static files.
